# Barebones MIPS cross-compiler & toolchain

There are two platform flavors, 32- and 64-bit depending on your host Linux x86 environment.
The correct one is automatically chosen when the `setenv.sh` script is run.

## Setup details

Run the `setenv.sh` script one directory above to configure your PATH:

    $ . setenv.sh

    $ mips-gcc --version
